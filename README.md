# Smartphone Price Tier Classification

This project uses machine learning to classify smartphones into different price tiers (Budget, Mid-Range, and Flagship) based on their technical specifications. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and a comparative evaluation of several classification models. The **Random Forest Classifier** was identified as the best-performing model, achieving an average accuracy of **86.6%** in cross-validation.

## üéØ Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate a machine learning model that can accurately predict a smartphone's price category (Budget, Mid-Range, or Flagship) using its features, such as brand, processor, camera quality, and battery capacity.

## üßæ Dataset
The project utilizes the `Smartphones_cleaned_dataset.csv` file. This dataset contains various technical specifications for numerous smartphone models.

**Key Features in the Dataset:**
- `brand_name`
- `price` and `rating`
- `has_5g`, `has_nfc`, `has_ir_blaster`
- `processor_brand`, `num_cores`, `processor_speed`
- `battery_capacity`, `ram_capacity`, `internal_memory`
- `primary_camera_rear`, `primary_camera_front`

The initial data required cleaning to handle missing values, which were imputed using median for numerical columns and mode for categorical columns.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several visualizations were created to understand the relationships and distributions within the data:
1.  **Price Distribution**: A histogram showed the frequency distribution of smartphone prices.
2.  **Price vs. Rating**: A scatter plot was used to examine the correlation between price and user ratings.
3.  **Top Brands**: A bar chart highlighted the top 10 brands with the highest number of models in the dataset.
4.  **Feature Correlation**: A heatmap visualized the correlation between the different numerical features of the smartphones.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
1.  **Data Cleaning**: Missing values were handled by imputing with median for numerical features and mode for categorical ones.
2.  **Feature Engineering**: A target variable, `price_tier`, was created by categorizing the `price` column into three classes:
    - **Budget**: price < 20,000
    - **Mid-Range**: 20,000 <= price < 50,000
    - **Flagship**: price >= 50,000
3.  **Preprocessing**: A `ColumnTransformer` pipeline was built to scale numerical features using `StandardScaler` and encode categorical features using `OneHotEncoder`.
4.  **Model Comparison**: Five different classification models were trained and evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation:
    - Decision Tree
    - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Random Forest
    - Naive Bayes
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## üèÜ Model Performance
The cross-validation results showed that the **Random Forest** model performed the best.

| Model               | Avg. Accuracy | Std Deviation |
|---------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Random Forest** | **0.8663** | **0.0234** |
| SVM                 | 0.8582        | 0.0231        |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 0.8469        | 0.0326        |
| Decision Tree       | 0.8367        | 0.0141        |
| Naive Bayes         | NaN           | NaN           |

### Detailed Analysis of Random Forest
The best model (Random Forest) was further analyzed on a held-out test set.
- **Confusion Matrix**: This shows the model's performance for each class, highlighting where it makes correct and incorrect predictions.
- **ROC Curve**: The multi-class ROC curve illustrates the model's ability to distinguish between the different price tiers.
